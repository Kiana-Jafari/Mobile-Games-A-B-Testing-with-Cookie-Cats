### Mobile Games A/B Testing with Cookie Cats

Welcome to this notebook! This Project was mainly focused on A/B Testing, different types of sampling methods used in statistics, and Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA). In this analysis, we evaluated the impact of gate placement on player retention in the mobile game Cookie Cats. The game initially placed a gate at level 30, requiring players to wait or make an in-app purchase to proceed. To test the effects of this gate placement, an A/B test was conducted where the gate was moved from level 30 to level 40 for a subset of players.

The dataset included information from over 90,000 players, tracking their game rounds played and retention rates. We focused on two key metrics: 1-day and 7-day retention, which are critical indicators of player engagement.

Our findings showed a notable difference in retention rates between the two groups, indicating that the placement of the gate significantly influences player behavior. The analysis provides valuable insights that can guide future decisions on game design to optimize player retention and satisfaction.

A general overview of the project:
- Analyzed data from an A/B test in the mobile game Cookie Cats to assess the impact of gate placement on player retention
- Evaluated whether moving the gate from level 30 to level 40 affected key player engagement metrics, specifically 1-day and 7-day retention rates
- Conducted exploratory data analysis, visualized the distribution of game rounds played, and calculated retention rates for both control and experimental groups
- Identified that the gate change had a measurable impact on player retention, providing actionable insights for game design adjustments
